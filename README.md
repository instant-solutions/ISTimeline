## Requirements
- iOS 8.0 or higher
- Swift 3

## Installation

### CocoaPods
ISTimeline is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod 'ISTimeline'
```

### Carthage
ISTimeline is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Include the following line into your Cartfile and follow the instructions under [getting started](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started):

```
github "instant-solutions/ISTimeline"
```

### Manually

Just drop the files ISPoint.swift and ISTimeline.swift into your project.

## Usage

### Import
```swift
import ISTimeline
```

### Integration
We recommend to use the timeline view in your storyboard. Just add a plain view and set the custom class and the module property to `ISTimeline`.

![Custom class](/screenshots/custom_class.png "Custom class")

Or add the view programmatically:

```swift
let frame = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 20.0, width: 300.0, height: 400.0)

let timeline = ISTimeline(frame: frame)
timeline.backgroundColor = .white

self.view.addSubview(timeline)
```

### ISPoint
Each bubble is represented by an ISPoint object in the points array. ISPoints has several properties:  
`var title:String` shown in the bubble  
`var description:String?` shown below the bubble  
`var pointColor:UIColor` the color of each point in the line  
`var lineColor:UIColor` the color of the line after a point  
`var touchUpInside:Optional<(_ point:ISPoint) -> Void>` a callback, which is triggered after a touch inside a bubble  
`var fill:Bool` fills the point in the line (default: `false`)

Example point:
```swift
let point = ISPoint(title: "my title")
point.description = "my awesome description"
point.lineColor = .red
point.fill = true
```

#### Initializers
The designated initializer is:
```swift
ISPoint(title:String, description:String, pointColor:UIColor, lineColor:UIColor, touchUpInside:Optional<(_ point:ISPoint) -> Void>, fill:Bool)
```

You also can use one the convenience initializers:
```swift
ISPoint(title:String, description:String, touchUpInside:Optional<(_ point:ISPoint) -> Void>)
```
```swift
ISPoint(title:String, touchUpInside:Optional<(_ point:ISPoint) -> Void>)
```

Or even this one:
```swift
ISPoint(title:String)
```

#### Touch events
To get touch events you just have to set a callback closure to the property `point.touchUpInside`. It is triggered after a touch up inside a bubble.

```swift
point.touchUpInside =
  { (point:ISPoint) in
    // do something
}
```

### Add points to the timeline
To add points to the timeline you can simple create and set your points array to the property `timeline.points` or you can append each point one after the other.
```swift
let myPoints = [
  ISPoint(title: "first"),
  ISPoint(title: "second"),
  ISPoint(title: "third")
]
timeline.points = myPoints
```
Append a single point:
```swift
timeline.points.append(ISPoint(title: "fourth"))
```

### Colors
You can customize the following timeline colors:  
`var bubbleColor:UIColor` color of every bubble (default `.init(red: 0.75, green: 0.75, blue: 0.75, alpha: 1.0)`)  
`var titleColor:UIColor` color of the title in the bubble (default `.white`)  
`var descriptionColor:UIColor` color the description text (default `.gray`)  
Points can be colored as described above.

### Line width and point radius
Some common parameters can be adjusted:  
`var pointDiameter:CGFloat` diameter of a point in the line (default `6.0`)  
`var lineWidth:CGFloat` the thickness of the line (default `2.0`)  
`var bubbleRadius:CGFloat` the radius of the bubble corners (default `2.0`)  

### Bubble arrows
With the flag `var bubbleArrows:Bool` it is possible to remove all arrows (default `true`).  
With arrows:  
![Bubble with arrow](/screenshots/bubble_with_arrow.png "Bubble with arrow")

And without arrows:  
![Bubble without arrow](/screenshots/bubble_without_arrow.png "Bubble without arrow")

### Intents
You can add some padding by setting the content insets. This currently can only be done programmatically.
```swift
timeline.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(20.0, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0)
```

### Clip subviews
Per default, the timeline clips all subviews to its bounds. If you would like to change this behavior just set it to `false`.
```swift
timeline.clipsToBounds = false
```

## Working example
```swift
let frame = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 20.0, width: 300.0, height: 400.0)
let timeline = ISTimeline(frame: frame)
timeline.backgroundColor = .white
timeline.bubbleColor = .init(red: 0.95, green: 0.95, blue: 0.95, alpha: 1.0)
timeline.titleColor = .black
timeline.descriptionColor = .darkText
timeline.pointDiameter = 7.0
timeline.lineWidth = 2.0
timeline.bubbleRadius = 0.0

self.view.addSubview(timeline)

for i in 0...9 {
    let point = ISPoint(title: "point \(i)")
    point.description = "my awesome description"
    point.lineColor = i % 2 == 0 ? .red : .green
    point.pointColor = point.lineColor
    point.touchUpInside =
        { (point:ISPoint) in
            print(point.title)
    }

    timeline.points.append(point)
}
```

## Demo

ISTimelineDemo is a simple demo app which shows the usage of ISTimeline in a storyboard.

## TODOs
- [ ] show images in the timeline
- [ ] animate the appending and removing of an entry
